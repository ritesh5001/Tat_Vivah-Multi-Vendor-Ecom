/**
 * Single source of truth for "is there a session, and what token do we send?".
 *
 * Before this module, six different places answered that question with six
 * different rules: the middleware accepted `access || refresh`, the cart page
 * demanded `access` only, the header derived "signed in" from the access
 * cookie alone, and the product page accepted either. A state that satisfied
 * one check but not another sent the buyer around the login loop forever —
 * middleware let them onto /cart, the page bounced them to /login, login saw a
 * valid session and bounced them back.
 *
 * Two rules keep that from recurring:
 *
 *  1. Session presence is decided ONLY by `hasSession()` — everywhere.
 *  2. Token *validity* is never inferred from cookie presence. A cookie can
 *     outlive the JWT inside it, so validity is read from the JWT's own `exp`
 *     and a stale token is refreshed rather than treated as "logged out".
